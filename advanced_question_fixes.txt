STUDENT ASSISTANT SEMESTER HOURS CALCULATION - Student assistants work a maximum of 100 hours per month. In a typical 4-month semester, this equals approximately 400 hours per semester (100 hours/month Ã— 4 months = 400 hours/semester).
end

GRADUATION DEFICIENCY CLEARANCE SPECIFIC - All deficiencies must be cleared three (3) working days before the University-wide Academic Council meeting. This is a strict deadline that students must meet to be eligible for graduation.
end

TRANSFEREE GRADUATION HONORS REQUIREMENTS - For transferees to graduate with honors at PRMSU, they must meet additional requirements beyond GWA: 1) Complete all academic units at PRMSU (residency requirement), 2) Carry the regular academic load throughout their studies, 3) Finish within the prescribed time frame for their program, and 4) Have no failing grades, incomplete grades, or disciplinary violations on record. Those meeting GWA requirements but not residency or load requirements receive a Certificate of Graduation with Academic Distinction instead.

LIQUOR RELATED VIOLATIONS COMPLETE - PRMSU's liquor-related offense policy covers multiple violations: entering the university intoxicated, possessing alcohol on campus, using alcohol on campus, selling alcohol on campus, and consuming alcohol on campus. All these violations carry progressive penalties with the same structure.
end

OUTBOUND CROSS ENROLMENT APPROVAL PROCESS - Outbound cross-enrolment requests must be approved by the Dean and Registrar. This is generally allowed only when the course or subject is not offered at PRMSU during the specific academic year and term, the host school has a comparable standard of education, and typically only general education subjects are permitted for cross-enrolment at other institutions.
