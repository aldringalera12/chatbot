INBOUND CROSS-ENROLMENT:
This type of enrolment depends on the availability of 
courses and slots for a given school year and term. Applicants must submit a signed letter 
stating the reason for choosing PRMSU, the specific academic year and term, the courses 
with descriptions, and their contact details. Additional requirements include a cross
enrolment permit from the home school (if courses are for credit), a medical clearance 
validated by PRMSUâ€™s Medical and Dental Services, a recommendation letter from the 
Dean, and a certification of good moral character from the Guidance Office of the home 
institution. Students may enroll provided their total units do not exceed the allowed 
academic load, unless otherwise approved by the Dean or Registrar for valid reasons.
