ADMISSION:
PRMSU admits students regardless of age, sex, status, nationality, religion, 
or political beliefs, provided they comply with all university rules and requirements. 
Persons with disabilities are accepted under RA 7277, with facilities such as ramps and 
priority lanes to support their needs. Indigenous peoples are likewise admitted under RA 
8371, ensuring equal rights and opportunities. Working students may enroll upon fulfilling 
academic requirements, but must follow their schedules and college policies. All 
applicants must pass the PRMSU Admission Test (if applicable) and meet the GPA/GWA 
required by their college. Beginning freshmen must not have previously enrolled in a 
degree program elsewhere, though vocational course completers may be admitted as 
new students. Concurrent enrollment in another institution is prohibited. Individual 
colleges and campuses may also enforce additional admission policies.
