# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Build Timeout Issue - SOLVED âœ…

### Problem:
Railway build was timing out during Docker build process.

### Root Causes:
1. **Heavy Dependencies**: ChromaDB and sentence-transformers are large packages
2. **Inefficient Dockerfile**: Not optimized for Railway's build time limits
3. **Unnecessary Files**: Including test files and documentation in build

### Solutions Applied:

#### 1. Optimized Dockerfile âœ…
- **Faster base image**: Using `python:3.11-slim`
- **Better layer caching**: Copy requirements first
- **Reduced dependencies**: Specific versions to avoid resolution delays
- **Minimal system packages**: Only essential build tools

#### 2. Improved .dockerignore âœ…
- **Exclude test files**: `test_*.py`, `demo_*.py`, etc.
- **Exclude documentation**: `*.md` files
- **Exclude development files**: IDE configs, logs, etc.
- **Smaller build context**: Faster upload to Railway

#### 3. Fixed requirements.txt âœ…
- **Pinned versions**: Avoid dependency resolution delays
- **Compatible versions**: Tested working combinations

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Optimized Dockerfile (Recommended)
```bash
# The current Dockerfile is now optimized
git add .
git commit -m "Optimize Dockerfile for Railway"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Use Lightweight Dockerfile
```bash
# If still having issues, use the lightweight version
mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.original
mv Dockerfile.light Dockerfile
git add .
git commit -m "Use lightweight Dockerfile"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Railway Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:
```
COHERE_API_KEY=m7uIZhmn9itLRlZmEvHVwIJ6nvJ0FU2zZ5vd40e9
PORT=8000
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
DB_PATH=/app/vector_db
```

## Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### 1. Build Timeout
**Symptoms**: "Build timed out" in logs
**Solutions**:
- âœ… Use optimized Dockerfile (already done)
- âœ… Exclude unnecessary files (already done)
- âœ… Pin dependency versions (already done)

### 2. Memory Issues
**Symptoms**: "Killed" or "Out of memory" during build
**Solutions**:
- Use Railway Pro plan (more memory)
- Reduce dependencies in requirements.txt
- Use lighter alternatives

### 3. Startup Issues
**Symptoms**: App builds but doesn't start
**Solutions**:
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify PORT environment variable
- Check health endpoint responds

### 4. Database Issues
**Symptoms**: "Database not initialized" errors
**Solutions**:
- Ensure all .txt files are included
- Check vector_db directory is created
- Verify init_database.py runs correctly

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Check Build Logs
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your deployment
- Check build logs for errors

### 2. Check Runtime Logs
- Look for "âœ… Chatbot initialized successfully"
- Check for database initialization messages
- Verify no error messages

### 3. Test Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test chat
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What does PRMSU stand for?"}'
```

## If Still Having Issues

### 1. Check Railway Status
- Visit Railway status page
- Check for platform issues

### 2. Try Manual Build
```bash
# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t prmsu-chatbot .
docker run -p 8000:8000 prmsu-chatbot
```

### 3. Simplify Dependencies
If still timing out, try minimal requirements.txt:
```
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
pydantic==2.5.0
cohere==4.57
chromadb==0.4.24
```

- Railway Help: help@railway.app

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Build Success**: "Build completed successfully"
âœ… **App Started**: "âœ… Chatbot initialized successfully"
âœ… **Database Ready**: "ðŸ“Š Database contains X definitions"
âœ… **Health Check**: `/health` returns 200 OK
âœ… **Chat Working**: `/chat` responds to questions

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly** with the test script
2. **Update Android app** with Railway URL
3. **Monitor performance** in Railway dashboard
4. **Scale if needed** based on usage

Your PRMSU chatbot should now deploy successfully to Railway! ðŸš€
