SUMMARIZED HISTORY – The President Ramon Magsaysay State University (PRMSU), 
the lone state university in Zambales with seven campuses, was officially established 
through Republic Act No. 11015 on April 20, 2018, renaming the former Ramon Magsaysay 
Technological University (RMTU).
Its roots trace back to the early 1900s when its main campus in Iba began as a farm school in 1910, 
later evolving through several name changes before becoming the Ramon Magsaysay Polytechnic College (RMPC) 
in 1995. Other campuses also developed independently: the Western Luzon Agricultural College (WLAC) 
in San Marcelino (founded 1927) and the Candelaria School of Fisheries (CSF) (founded 1965),
which were merged with RMPC in 1998 under R.A. 8498 to form RMTU.
During its early years as RMTU, leadership under Dr. David Andres (1998–2000) 
and Dr. Feliciano Rosete (2001–2013) oversaw the transition into a multi-campus system,
expansion of degree programs, and establishment of satellite campuses in Masinloc, 
Castillejos, and Sta. Cruz.
Dr. Cornelio Garcia (2013–2021) pushed for the renaming to PRMSU, 
broadening academic offerings and spearheading infrastructure, research, 
and accreditation achievements. He became the first PRMSU president under the new charter, 
implementing the LEGACY governance framework that emphasized quality education, good governance, 
and sustainable growth.
On February 3, 2021, Dr. Roy Villalobos succeeded as the second PRMSU president, 
introducing the LEADERSHIP strategic agenda to drive the university’s vision of 
becoming a premier Smart University.
Under his administration, PRMSU has expanded its accredited programs, research outputs, 
partnerships, and student-centered services, while maintaining ISO 9001:2015 certification.
Today, PRMSU continues to be the leading higher education institution in Zambales, 
committed to producing globally competitive graduates, advancing research, and serving its communities.
